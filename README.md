# Tutorial GITHUB:

First of all, you have to clone the project in a directory of your choosing.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite.git
  ```

After that, for every modification you're going to do, addition you're going to add. Create a new branch of the project:
  ```
  ## for BRANCH_NAME, let's follow the same standards to avoid confusion: (backend/frontend)-(functionality_name)
  git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
  ```


After editing or adding your things:
  ```
  git add -A
  git commit -m "small description here"
  ```

Then, push the branch to github:
  ```
  git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME
  ```

At this point, you can find your branch in https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite/branches

Maybe the main branch which is   ``` main ``` already changed while you are doing your modifications. It's better to use
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```
This brings any changes that have been made in the main branch, and grap the changes to your branch to avoid merge conflicts.

After this, you have to create a new PULL request on your branch. https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite/branches
Here, you can put some detailed information if needed and just validate it.

I'll check it out, verify it and confirm it.

After the branch is merged, it'll be deleted from github.


# HOW TO ADD EMAIL (NECESSARY):

Go to ```C:\xampp\sendmail``` and open ```sendmail.ini  ```

Modify these parameters

  ```
smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587
smtp_ssl=tls
error_logfile=error.log
debug_logfile=debug.log
 ```

Then go to ```C:\xampp\php``` and open ```php.ini  ```

Modify these
  ```
[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587
sendmail_from =sender@gmail.com
sendmail_path = "C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe -t"
mail.add_x_header=On
  ```

During the repetitive testing, I discovered that GMAIL allows you to send only some few messages before banning you until the next day. Most likely to prevent spamming. 
 
Because of this, I had to make multiple accounts, try them and check if they worked. All email-related errors will be displayed in the  ``` error.log  ``` next to the ```sendemail.ini``` file.


 ```
auth_username=joe.localhost1@gmail.com
auth_password=jwssmhaexympwgpl
 ```
  ```
auth_username=joe.localhost2@gmail.com
auth_password=yfebrxnecjwpppli

  ```

Please try not to spam emails, it'll block all email-related functionality for a day, which will be really inconvenient for all of us (UPDATE: The emails are no longer working)

I already taken care of the server-side code inside the Class ``` Emailer.php ```. Feel free to check it.

# HOW TO SET UP WEBSITE (NECESSARY):

This wasnâ€™t done just because it looks cool; it actually helps with routing, especially for images.

Go to ```C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra```, and open ```httpd-vhosts.conf```. Add this:

```
 <VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot    "C:/XAMPP/htdocs/teamWorkProj"
    ServerName      isetso.local
    ServerAlias www.isetso.local
 </VirtualHost>
```

Then go to ```c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts``` and open ```hosts``` file. Add this:

```
127.0.0.1       isetso.local
```

Restart XAMPP Apache and MySQL.

From now on, use this link to enter the website:

```
http://isetso.local/
```
